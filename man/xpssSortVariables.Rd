\examples{
data(fromXPSS)

xpssSortVariables(fromXPSS, by = "NAME")

xpssSortVariables(fromXPSS, by = "NAME", order = "D")

xpssSortVariables(fromXPSS, by = "TYPE", order = "A")

xpssSortVariables(fromXPSS, by = "TYPE", order = "D")

xpssSortVariables(fromXPSS, by = "COLUMNS", order = "A")

xpssSortVariables(fromXPSS, by = "COLUMNS", order = "D")
